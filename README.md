# PROJECT-1
# **Event Finder Application ** #

This is an Event Finder Application that allows you to search for your city of interest, and find events that are occurring at local venues. The cities are saved in the Firebase database and stored as buttons on the front-end. The client can click on the city button created at the top of the page to view teh most current events. A Youtube video will display next to the event so the user can listen and view the artist/comedian/band that is performing.
